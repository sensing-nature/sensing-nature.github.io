1989 2018 NEW DELHI URBANIZATION The worst polluted city in the world New Delhi is a massive city that has experienced a huge expansion in a few years. It’s the biggest city in the world after Tokyo and is worryingly overcrowded, counting with more than 28 million people. The urban sprawl has overflowed urban managment and poor people is force to move in suburbs or slums, perpetuating their poverty. Furthermore, the people migration from rural to urban aeras looking for industrial job and a better life get this places in the city in a worse situation, becaming unsanity spots in peripheral and marginal areas. To conclude, the fast urbanization has deforestated the natural spaces in a blink of an eye, causing a urban heat island and a increase in temperature, so light and noise pollution, creating the photochemical smog, makes this city one of the most polluted on the planet.
