BRAZIL EXPORTS TO EU AT THE EXPENSE OF THE AMAZON Illegal deforestation by fire in the Amazon’s jungle is becaming a regular practice between the upper echelons of the agro-food industry, like soya plantations and beef meat, to meet first- world market demands. The flourishing vegetarian market and the old and aggressive meat market of the last decades is encouraging to break the environmental laws in order to satisfy the first-world customers and consumers of this kind of products at the cost of the Amazon health. EU imports a lot of this staff participating and promoting this kind of illigal practice. The consequences could be irreversible for the planet if we don’t curb this problem in time. Deforestation affects the atmosphere, soil, biodiversisty and us ultimetly. The solution: Do not buy this kind of products!
