CO2 Storage Nowadays, technology has been bringing us all kinds of comfort and progress, but it still cannot get the CO2 we have been producing efficiently. Due to the gradual melting of glaciers and permafrost, more CO2 is being released into the atmosphere each year and our global ecological footprint is being increased quickly and becomes an ecological deficit. So the main advantage is that the technology can remove some CO2 from the atmosphere artificially, but the disadvantage is that it is not cheap or energetically profitable yet, so it's not an option, because it is not worth to produce more that we can capture. In short, the simplest way to get CO2 out of the atmosphere is to stop producing it. CO2 Storage
