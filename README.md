# Sensing Nature
I consider myself a creative person, a wild adventurer and a cultural traveler. I really enjoy creating outdoor social media content to promote environmental awareness. I also have a background in electronics and programming, so I often build inexpensive technological devices with microcomputers to extract useful and valuable environmental information.
